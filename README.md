# SMS Text Classification Notebook

## Project Overview
This repository hosts a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to the classification of SMS texts, aimed at distinguishing between spam and legitimate messages. Utilizing natural language processing and machine learning techniques, this notebook provides a step-by-step guide through the process of data handling, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering using text data
- Model training with different classifiers
- Performance analysis with various metrics

## Prerequisites
To execute the notebook, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

## Dependencies
To install all required dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
`requirements.txt` should be present in this repository and include libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, etc.
