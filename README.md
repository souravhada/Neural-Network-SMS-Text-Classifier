# Neural Network SMS Text Classifier

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at classifying SMS messages as either "ham" (non-spam) or "spam". The project utilizes a neural network model built with TensorFlow and trained on the SMS Spam Collection dataset. The classifier takes a message as input and predicts its likelihood of being spam.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to accurately classify SMS messages, providing a tool that could potentially be used to filter unwanted spam messages from important, legitimate ones. The model is trained on a pre-divided dataset consisting of training and validation subsets, ensuring a robust evaluation of its performance.

## Installation

This project is developed in Google Colaboratory, which provides a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment with all necessary dependencies pre-installed. However, if you wish to run this project locally, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
